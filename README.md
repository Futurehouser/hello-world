Introduction to Github

Hi everybody!

Benito here, I really like programming and I've been learning Python since the beginning of 2018. I hope I will learn a lot from now on, using Github, and I will do some cool big projects with other programmers.

Now than some months have passed, I'm learning Big Data applied to Business Inteligence.
